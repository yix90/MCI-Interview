# MCI-Interview

This git repository details the exercise given to Yixuan with his submissions.

The "MCI Interview" Jupyter notebook details the cleaning process for the first part of the assignment (with full details of the process).
A load_sqlite.py file is also included to allow the same cleaning to happen in one run.

"MCI2" Jupyter notebook is written for the 2nd part of the assignment.

Cheers,
Yixuan
